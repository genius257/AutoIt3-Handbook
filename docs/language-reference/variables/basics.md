# Basics

Variables in AutoIt3 are represented by a dollar sign followed by the name of the variable. The variable name is case-insensitive.

Variable names follow the same rules as other labels in AutoIt3. A valid variable name starts with a letter or underscore, followed by any number of letters, numbers, or underscores. As a regular expression, it would be expressed thus: ^[a-zA-Z_\x80-\xff][a-zA-Z0-9_\x80-\xff]*$

> Note: For our purposes here, a letter is a-z, A-Z, and the bytes from 128 through 255 (0x80-0xff).
