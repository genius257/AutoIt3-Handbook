# Coding Style Conventions

Coding style conventions are used in this sample series to aid clarity and consistency. The "Hungarian" notation conventions are used.  
They include variable prefix notations that give to variable names a suggestion of the type of the variable.

This page is based on [MSDN Coding Style Conventions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/stg/coding-style-conventions), modified to AutoIt3 needs.

The following table lists common variable prefixes.
